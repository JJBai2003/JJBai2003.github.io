        <h3>
          I am a current Sophomore at Cornell Engineering, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Philosophy. I
          was born and raised in Beijing, China. Then, I moved to Israel where I finished my 7th-9th grade. Finally, I
          moved to New York City at the beginning of my Sophomore year.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          I enjoy building technological products that make positive impacts on my community, which motivated me to
          participate in activities that allow me to explore different areas and applications of CS. In my free time,
          I enjoy browsing through and trying out amazing recipes, and I LOVE music. I am currently looking for summer
          internships related to software engineering or data science.
